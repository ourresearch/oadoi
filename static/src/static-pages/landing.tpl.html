                other software projects.

                Depsy currently works for the 11,223 Python and R research software packages available on <a
                    href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> and <a href="http://www.r-pkg.org/">CRAN.</a>
                Here are a few interesting ones:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="/package/python/GDAL">GDAL</a> is a geoscience library. Depsy finds
                        this cool NASA-funded
                        <a href="http://www.the-cryosphere.net/8/1509/2014/tc-8-1509-2014.html">ice map paper</a>
                        that mentions GDAL without
                        formally citing it. Also check out key author <a href="person/378948">Even Rouault:</a>
                        the project commit history demonstrates he deserves 27% credit for GDAL, even
                        though he's overlooked in more
                        <a href="http://gdal.org/credits.html">traditional credit systems.</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="/package/r/lubridate">lubridate</a> improves date handling for R. It's
                        not highly-cited, but we can see it's making a different kind of impact:
                        it's got a very high dependency PageRank, because it's reused by
                        over 1000 different R projects on GitHub and CRAN.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="/package/r/BradleyTerry2">BradleyTerry2</a> implements a probability technique in R.
                        It's only directly reused by 8 projects&mdash;but Depsy shows that one of those projects is itself
                        highly reused, leading to huge <em>indirect</em> impacts. This indirect reuse
                        gives BradleyTerry2 a very high dependency PageRank score, even though its direct
                        reuse is small, and that makes for a better reflection of real-world impact.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="/person/342746">Michael Droettboom</a> makes small (under 20%) contributions to
                        other people's research software, contributions
                        easy to overlook. But the contributions are meaningful, and they're to high-impact
                        projects, so in Depsy's transitive credit system he ends up as a highly-ranked contributor.
                        Depsy can help unsung heroes like Micheal get rewarded.
