      <p>Impactstory is an open-source website that helps researchers explore and share the the
          online impact of their research.
      </p>
       <p>

          By helping researchers tell data-driven stories about their work,
          we're helping to build a new scholarly reward system that values and encourages web-native scholarship.
          We’re funded by the National Science Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and
          incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation.

      <!--
      <p>Impactstory delivers <em>open metrics</em>, with <em>context</em>, for <em>diverse products</em>:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><b>Open metrics</b>: Our data (to the extent allowed by providers’ terms of service), <a href="https://github.com/total-impact">code</a>, and <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/03/01/18535014681/">governance</a> are all open.</li>
         <li><b>With context</b>: To help scientists move from raw <a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/">altmetrics</a> data to <a href="http://asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_Piwowar_Priem.html">impact profiles</a> that tell data-driven stories, we sort metrics by <em>engagement type</em> and <em>audience</em>. We also normalize based on comparison sets: an evaluator may not know if 5 forks on GitHub is a lot of attention, but they can understand immediately if their project ranked in the 95th percentile of all GitHub repos created that year.</li>
         <li><b>Diverse products</b>: Datasets, software, slides, and other research products are presented as an integrated section of a comprehensive impact report, alongside articles&mdash;each genre a first-class citizen, each making its own kind of impact.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="history">history</h3>
      <p>Impactstory began life as total-impact, a hackathon project at the Beyond Impact workshop in 2011. As the hackathon ended, a few of us migrated into a hotel hallway to continue working, eventually completing a 24-hour coding marathon to finish a prototype. Months of spare-time development followed, then funding.  We’ve got the same excitement for Impactstory today.</p>

      <p>In early 2012, Impactstory was given £17,000 through the <a href="http://beyond-impact.org/">Beyond Impact project</a> from the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Foundation</a>.  Today Impactstory is funded by the <a href="http://sloan.org/">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a>, first through <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/03/29/20131290500/">a $125,000 grant</a> in mid 2012 and then <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/2013/06/17/sloan/">a two-year grant for $500,000</a> starting in 2013.  We also received <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/2013/09/27/impactstory-awarded-300k-nsf-grant/">a $300,000 grant</a> from the National Science Foundation to study how automatically-gathered impact metrics can improve the reuse of research software. </p>

      <h3 id="why">philosophy</h3>
      <p>As a philanthropically-funded not-for-profit, we're in this because we believe open altmetrics are key for building the coming era of Web-native science. We're committed to:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="https://github.com/total-impact">open source</a></li>
         <li><a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/2012/06/08/24638498595/">free and open data</a>, to the extent permitted by data providers</li>
